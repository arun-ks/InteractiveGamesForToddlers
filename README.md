## Co-Development with ChatGPT
Most of the games were created with ChatGPT. The quick prototyping allowed revision & refinement of requirements.

The final code was created after many back-and-forth as the generated code had to be troubleshooted. I had to suggest corrections & improvements in the code till we got to the final forms.

### Prompt to get Prompt
Once the final code is generated, the following prompt was used to generate prompt for the thread.

> Please give me a full chatGPT prompt which would have generated the last HTML .
> The prompt should be detailed so that if some other use sends the same prompt, an almost identical html file would be generated.
